what is checks ?

Terraform, "checks" typically refer to a validation process that ensures your infrastructure code meets certain criteria before deployment. These checks help catch errors, inconsistencies, or potential issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and unexpected behavior in your deployed infrastructure. Checks can be performed manually or automatically through various tools and practices. Here are a few common types of checks in the Terraform context:

1. Syntax Checks:
Syntax checks ensure that your Terraform configuration files are written correctly and follow the correct syntax rules. This includes validating that your code is properly formatted, free of syntax errors, and follows the correct structure of Terraform's HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

2. Linting:
Linting involves using tools that analyze your Terraform code to identify and flag potential issues, adherence to best practices, and code styling consistency. Linting tools can catch issues such as deprecated resource configurations, missing documentation, and more.

3. Static Code Analysis:
Static code analysis tools examine your Terraform code without actually running it. They can identify security vulnerabilities, resource misconfigurations, and other potential problems based on code patterns and predefined rules.

4. Plan Validation:
Before applying your Terraform configuration, you can use the terraform plan command to generate an execution plan. This plan provides a preview of the changes that will be made to your infrastructure. You can review the plan to ensure that it aligns with your intentions before actually applying the changes.

5. Security Checks:
Security checks involve reviewing your Terraform code for potential security risks. This could include exposing sensitive data, granting excessive permissions, or using insecure configuration settings. Tools like HashiCorp's Sentinel can help enforce security policies during the Terraform development process.

6. Compliance Checks:
Compliance checks ensure that your infrastructure configurations adhere to regulatory or organizational compliance requirements. These checks can involve ensuring that certain security controls, access controls, or data protection measures are properly implemented.

7. Peer Review:
A manual form of checks involves peer reviews, where team members review each other's code to catch errors, provide feedback, and ensure that the configuration meets the project's requirements and standards.

8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines:
CI/CD pipelines automate checks by integrating various tools and processes into your development workflow. Automated checks can be triggered with each code commit, helping catch issues early and promoting a consistent and reliable deployment process.

Incorporating checks into your Terraform development process helps improve the quality, security, and reliability of your infrastructure code. It reduces the likelihood of introducing misconfigurations that could lead to downtime, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected behavior in your deployed environments.
